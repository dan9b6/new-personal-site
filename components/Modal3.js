          The year I was born. The year Take That separated and the year 'Dolly'
          the sheep was born. What a time to be alive!

          My first day at school was at Lilliput Primary School. Who could of
          known I would end up here coding and programming my way into the world
          of tech.

        <p>
          I went to my first ever football match - Arsenal vs Southampton. Since
          my trip to this beautiful stadium, being an Arsenal fan has definitely
          become more and more painful over the years. I hope that being a fan
          of this club won't be a dealbreaker!

        <p>
          My first job was landed. I became a paperboy! Monday to Saturday at
          6:30am I would make my way down to my local newsagents to collect my
          round and get underway. Wasn't the dream role - but that Â£25 a week
          went a long way back then.

        <h2>2011</h2>
        <p>
          I was (and still am) obsessed with football. Fortunately, I had the
          opportunity to play for Yeovil FC Academy. During this time I played
          against a number of academy teams at the highest level. However, I
          didn't quite make the cut.

        <p>
          I had finished my GCSE's! I managed to get 11 GCSE's all A-C -
          including an A in Maths, Biology and P.E. So to celebrate my exams, me
          and a few friends went to Cardiff for the Olympic Games to watch GB
          take on South Korea. Unfortunately they lost 5-4 on penalties.

        <h2>2015</h2>
        <p>
          I began my first job in Educational Sales at The Training Room. This
          was my first exposure to the world of tech. Originallly I began
          selling Personal Training courses. However, I then moved into selling
          Software & Web Development training courses. Whilst working at The
          Training Room I worked with a team of Sales Executives trying to help
          people change their career's and enter into the world of IT. It was
          during this time that I started to look into these areas myself and my
          interest in the sector began to increase.

        <h2>2019</h2>
        <p>
          At the start of 2019, I decided to go travelling in Thailand. It was a
          truly incredible experience and during my time I visited many islands,
          met people from around the world, many adventure days and of course -
          went to many bars. However, during my time in Asia, it gave me a real
          chance to reflect on what I wanted to do when I got back home - which
          is when I started looking into roles in tech.

        <h2>2019</h2>
        <p>
          I started learning how to code. I became a regular at CodeAcademy and
          Stack OverFlow. First of all, I started to learn HTML and CSS. I found
          it incredibly rewarding building something from nothing and having it
          appear in front of me. I was creating a number of static web pages and
          trialling different effects and animations that I could use for future
          websites. I then moved onto basic Javascript. This is when I knew I
          wanted become a Web Developer and get some professional training and
          qualifications.

          <p>
            I graduated as a Web Developer through Ironhack Tech Bootcamp -
            Lisbon. During the course I covered a number of technologies and
            languages. Such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS/SASS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>React JS</li>
            <li>Node</li>
            <li>Express</li>
            <li>Mongo DB</li>
            <li>
              <span>
                and many other skills which you can find on this
                <a
                  href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-burton-654ba4180/"
                  target="_blank"
                >
                  {" "}
                  link.
                </a>
              </span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This whole experience was a real eye-opener for me. I never thought
            it would be possible to learn as much as I did during this bootcamp
            and leave with three fully functional projects.

        <p>
          I began an apprenticeship with BenDando. Currently, most of the work I
          am doing involves using React and Next JS. I am heavily involved in
          the front-end development to - where I am using HTML, CSS/SASS, JS and
          other Web Design tools such as MDB Bootstrap. I have also had a little
          exposure to Shopify and Sanity - which is a headless CMS software.
